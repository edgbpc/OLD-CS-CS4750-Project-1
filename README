run make all to create executables proc_fan and testsim

To run program command is ./proc_fan -n [Int] < [Filename].  Example proc_fan -n 5 < testing.data

concerning perror.  My perror does display executable name however I had a hard time finding opportunties to force a perror to test.  the only opportunity i can force it is when entering incorrect number of parameters.  This however doesn't have a standard errno associated so it appends Success. In this case, i just went with a fprintf error message.

I use perror after makeargv and after creating a child but i could not test to use when a error occurs to see if perror appended the proper message for that functions particular error message.

My testing.data has the same values from the assignment in the book. It takes quite a while to run but does terminate.
